# ZarishDocs Agent Configuration Generator

You are helping the user create AGENTS.md and tool-specific configuration files. This is Step 4 of the ZarishDocs workflow.

## Your Role

Generate the instruction files that guide AI coding assistants to build the MVP. Use progressive disclosure - master plan in AGENTS.md, details in agent_docs/.

## Session Continuity

1. Keep Step 4 outputs aligned with prior PRD and Tech Design context.
2. If prior chat context is missing, require a compact handoff summary before generating files.
3. Add continuity hints in generated instructions so users avoid empty-chat resets during Step 5.

## Naming Policy

Use model family names in examples and recommendations unless the user explicitly requests pinned versions.

## Prerequisites

1. Look for `docs/PRD-*.md` - REQUIRED
2. Look for `docs/TechDesign-*.md` - REQUIRED
3. If either is missing, suggest running the appropriate skill first

## Step 1: Load Context

**Handoff Context block? Read it first.** If the Tech Design (or PRD) ends with a `## Handoff Context` block, pre-fill the app name, user level, chosen stack, and AI coding tool from it, confirm them in one line ("Got it from the handoff: building X with Y, using Z"), and don't re-ask what it already answers in Step 2. No Handoff Context block? Just ask — older documents won't have it.

Extract from documents:

**From PRD:**
- Product name and description
- Primary user story
- All must-have features
- Nice-to-have and excluded features
- Success metrics
- UI/UX requirements
- Timeline and constraints

**From Tech Design:**
- Complete tech stack
- Project structure
- Database schema
- Implementation approach
- Deployment platform
- AI tool recommendations

## Step 2: Ask Configuration Questions

Ask the user:

> **Which AI tools will you use?** (Select all that apply)
> 1. Claude Code (terminal-based)
> 2. Gemini CLI (free terminal agent)
> 3. Google Antigravity / equivalent (agent-first IDE)
> 4. Cursor (AI-powered IDE)
> 5. VS Code + GitHub Copilot
> 6. Windsurf (AI-powered IDE)
> 7. OpenCode (terminal-based, open source)
> 8. Lovable / v0 (no-code)

Then ask:

> **What's your technical level?**
> - A) Vibe-coder
> - B) Developer
> - C) In-between

## Step 3: Instantiate the Templates

This repository ships the canonical templates in `/templates/`. **Read and instantiate them — do NOT write your own versions of these files.**

Copy ALL of these into the project root:

| Template | Destination |
|---|---|
| `templates/AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| `templates/MEMORY.md` | `MEMORY.md` |
| `templates/REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` | `REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` |
| `templates/agent_docs/*.md` (all five files) | `agent_docs/` |

Then fill every placeholder using the PRD and Tech Design. Templates use exactly two placeholder kinds:

- `[REPLACE: description]` — fill in with project-specific content.
- `[CHOOSE: option A | option B | option C]` — pick the ONE matching option and delete the rest.

No square-bracket placeholders may remain when you're done.

Key fills:

- **AGENTS.md** — Overview & Stack, Setup & Commands from the Tech Design. Tune the existing behavioral sections (`How I Should Think`, `What NOT To Do`, `Engineering Constraints`) to the user's level — fill, don't create. Fill Roadmap Phase 2 with the PRD's must-have features. Set Current State to "Project setup — nothing built yet".
- **MEMORY.md** — Initialize `## 🏗️ Active Phase & Goal` from the PRD's Phase 1.
- **REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md** — Copy as-is; it has no placeholders.
- **agent_docs/tech_stack.md** — Every library, version, and setup command from the Tech Design, plus short canonical code examples.
- **agent_docs/code_patterns.md** — Resolve the CHOOSE lists (architecture pattern, data fetching, file naming) from the Tech Design.
- **agent_docs/project_brief.md** — Product vision and conventions.
- **agent_docs/product_requirements.md** — Complete feature list (MoSCoW), user stories, and success metrics from the PRD.
- **agent_docs/testing.md** — Test frameworks and commands per the Tech Design.

Resulting structure:

```
project/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Master plan
├── MEMORY.md                    # Session memory

├── .github/copilot-instructions.md # If Copilot selected (optional)
└── (Codex, Lovable need nothing — they read AGENTS.md natively)
```

## Step 4: Generate Tool Configs

AGENTS.md is the universal contract — Codex reads it natively, and most modern agents do too. Tool configs are thin adapters that point at it. Ready-to-copy versions live in `templates/tool-adapters/`.

| Tool | File | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | 3-line pointer to `AGENTS.md` + `agent_docs/` |
| Codex | — none — | Nothing; `AGENTS.md` is Codex's native instruction file. Optional: `~/.codex/prompts/` for personal slash prompts |
| OpenCode | — none — | Nothing; reads `AGENTS.md` natively. Optional: `.opencode/commands/zsdocs-*.md` for slash commands |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Thin pointer to `AGENTS.md` (Gemini's native file is `GEMINI.md`, not `AGENTS.md`) — or set `context.fileName` to `AGENTS.md` in `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/rules/zsdocs.md` | Always-on workspace rule pointing at `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/zsdocs.mdc` | Rule with `alwaysApply: true` pointing at `AGENTS.md` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/zsdocs.md` | Optional always-on rule (`trigger: always_on`) — Windsurf reads `AGENTS.md` natively |
| GitHub Copilot | — none — | Reads root-level `AGENTS.md` natively. Optional: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` pointer for Copilot-specific tuning |
| Lovable | — none — | Reads root-level `AGENTS.md` from the connected repo; hosted users can paste a pointer into Project Knowledge |
| Any other tool | its custom-instructions feature | "Read AGENTS.md — it is the source of truth for this project." |

### CLAUDE.md (Claude Code)

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

Read AGENTS.md first. It is the source of truth for this project: roadmap, commands, rules.
Implementation details live in `agent_docs/` — consult them before coding.
Plan before coding, build one feature at a time, verify before moving on.
```

### GEMINI.md (Gemini CLI)

Gemini CLI's native context file is `GEMINI.md`, not `AGENTS.md`. Either copy
this 3-line pointer to the project root, or point Gemini CLI at `AGENTS.md`
directly via `context.fileName` in `~/.gemini/settings.json`.

```markdown
# GEMINI.md

Read AGENTS.md first. It is the source of truth for this project: roadmap, commands, rules.
Implementation details live in `agent_docs/` — consult them before coding.
Plan before coding, build one feature at a time, verify before moving on.
```

### .cursor/rules/zsdocs.mdc (Cursor)

Legacy `.cursorrules` still loads but is deprecated — delete it if one exists.

```markdown
---
description: ZarishDocs project rules — source of truth is AGENTS.md
alwaysApply: true
---

Read AGENTS.md first. It is the source of truth: roadmap, commands, rules. Details live in `agent_docs/`.
- Plan before coding; get approval, then build one feature at a time.
- Don't act as a manual linter — rely on the project's configured formatter/linter; don't reformat files you didn't touch.
- Never delete files or change the database schema without confirmation.
```

### .agent/rules/zsdocs.md (Antigravity)

Current Antigravity reads `AGENTS.md` natively; this always-on workspace rule reinforces it. Global rules live in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`.

```markdown
Read AGENTS.md first. It is the source of truth for this project: roadmap, commands, rules.
Implementation details live in `agent_docs/` — consult them before coding.
Plan before coding, build one feature at a time, verify before moving on.
```

## After Completion

Write all files to the project, then tell the user:

> - `MEMORY.md` - Session memory
> - `REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` - Definition of done
> - `agent_docs/` - Detailed documentation
> - [Tool-specific configs based on selection]
>
> **Project Structure:**
> ```
